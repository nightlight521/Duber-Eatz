# Duber Eatz
 Java grade 11 compsci project. Task is to find minimal delivery path given a map marked with walls, delivery locations, and microwaves. Microwaves cut your current amount of steps taken in half (integer division). Each delivery location also has their own tip number, which affects the amount of tips you receive. Where there are tips, maximum tip is the goal. 
 Maps are stored as text files, generally. An example is given. Furthermore, the path found by the program is outputted into a PPM image file.
